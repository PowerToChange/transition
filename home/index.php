    <p>One of the best ways to get a feel for campus life is to experience it first hand. On campuses across Canada we are excited to give you a totally unique kind of campus experience. You will get a feel for the school and also get to experience a vibrant campus ministry.</p>
	<p>Whether it's a campus tour, an apologetic training course, or a local P2C ministry event, we want to help you as you prepare for the transition into campus life.  You’ll have the chance to ask questions, meet other incoming first year Christians and learn about how faith and student life can thrive together.  We'd love to have you join us!</p>

  	"Getting involved with P2C has connected me with God, purpose, and Christ-centered genuine friendships which is why I would encourage high school students to get involved with P2C. You'll find people who genuinely care for you, a chance to encounter a next level relationship with Christ and an opportunity to learn the purpose God has for your life."

</dd>                    <dt><a href="">What activities do you have on campus?</a></dt>
            <dd><p>Each campus has its own feel and vibe, but here are a few of the things you would likely find on your campus as a first year student:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Outreaches</strong>- throughout the year we make intentional efforts to engage students on campus in discussions about Jesus. It could be a coffee house, debate, lecture, discussion group, movie showing.</li>
						<li><strong>Discipleship Groups</strong>- once a week meet up with a group of people from your program and year (or common interest) to grow together as you learn how to better share your faith with other students.</li>
						<li><strong>Weekly Meeting</strong>- a large group gathering with all students and staff involved with P2C on campus for a time of worship, fellowship and teaching.</li>
						<li><strong>Prayer</strong>- unite with your fellow students to pray for your campus, Canada and the world.</li>
					</ul>

            <dd><p>First year groups vary a bit from campus to campus, but every P2C group is focused on studying the Bible and equipping you to help other students discover Jesus. Groups are designed and encouraged to help you put what you’re learning into action.</p>
				<p>Here are three of the main resources you might use:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://powertochange.com/students/my-story"><strong>My Story</strong></a> – With literally hundreds of your friends just a status update away, imagine using your online presence to share what Jesus has done in your life! My Story is a small group training series that will invigorate your evangelism through the powerful intersection of social media, personal story and the gospel.</li>
						<li><a href="http://store.powertochange.org/p-13-bursting-your-bubble-dvd.aspx"><strong>Bursting Your Bubble</strong></a> – Meaningful relationships are the foundation for all effective evangelism. However, many Christians find that they have few, if any, close non-Christian friends. This 7 week series is designed to help you discover the joy of engaging others in spiritual dialogue. Together, you and your group will experience a faith adventure as you burst your bubble!</li>
						<li><a href="http://crupress.campuscrusadeforchrist.com/green/index.php/crucomm/"><strong>Cru.Comm</strong></a> – Cru.Comm, is a small group Bible study curriculum designed with a logical progression, that in the course of 3-4 years, could take a new Christian, ground them in the basics of the faith and grow them into a Christ-centered laborer.</p></li>
